# Content Management System

This smart contract is a decentralized content management system built on the Internet Computer (IC) using Azle. The system allows authors to create articles, allows editors to publish the articles created by authors, and allows admins to manage users and categories.

You can always refer to [The Azle Book](https://demergent-labs.github.io/azle/) for more in-depth documentation.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [IC SDK](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/quickstart)

## Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ICPHubPH/content-management-system-icp.git
cd content-management-system-icp
```

`dfx` is the tool you will use to interact with the IC locally and on mainnet. If you don't already have it installed:

```bash
npm run dfx_install
```

Next you will want to start a replica, which is a local instance of the IC that you can deploy your canisters to:

```bash
npm run replica_start
```

If you ever want to stop the replica:

```bash
npm run replica_stop
```

Now you can deploy your canister locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run canister_deploy_local
```

To call the methods on your canister:

```bash
npm run canister_call <METHOD_NAME>
```

Assuming you have [created a cycles wallet](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/quickstart/network-quickstart) and funded it with cycles, you can deploy to mainnet like this:

```bash
npm run canister_deploy_mainnet
```

## Deploying Local Internet Identity Instance

To deploy the local Internet Identity instance, run:

```bash
npm run internet_identity_deploy_local
```

## Generating declarations

To generate declarations for your dapp, run:

```bash
dfx generate cms
```
